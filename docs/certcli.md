# NDNCERT CLI Reference

The NDNCERT CLI tool can be used to interact with an [NDNCERT](https://github.com/named-data/ndncert) CA.
It allows entities to securely provision certificates after authenticating their identity with the CA.

This example illustrates how to get a certificate from the NDN Testbed CA.

## Getting the CA Certificate

To begin, you need to get the root CA certificate out of band.
The most recent certificates for the NDN Testbed can be obtained [here](https://named-data.net/ndn-testbed/).

If the certificate is in base64, you will need to convert it to TLV or PEM format.

```sh
cat testbed.root.base64 | base64 -d | ndnd sec pem-encode > testbed.root.pem
```

## Requesting a certificate

In this example, we will use the email challenge to request a certificate from the NDN Testbed CA.

Note that the specified output filename does not include an extension.
In this case, a new key will be created since no key is specified with `-k`.
The key will then be written to `alice.key` and the issued certificate to `alice.cert`.

```sh
ndnd certcli -o alice testbed.root.pem
```

The CLI will now prompt you for challenge type. Select the `email` challenge.

```text
Please choose a challenge type:
  1. email
  2. pin
Choice: 1
```

You will next be prompted for the email address to use for the challenge.

```text
Enter your email address: alice@named-data.net
```

The CLI will now attempt to request a certificate from the CA.

```text
================ CA Profile ===============
NDN Testbed NDNCERT CA (Demo)
Name: /ndn
Max Validity: 360h0m0s
Challenges: [email]
===========================================

Challenge Status: need-code
Enter the code sent to your email address:
```

You will receive an email with a code to enter.
On successful verification, the certificate will be issued, and the CLI
will write the key and certificate to the specified output files.

## Using an existing key

You can also use the CLI to certify an existing key.

```sh
# Create a new signing key
# We use a key name corresponding to alice@gmail.com
ndnd sec keygen /ndn/com/gmail/alice ecc secp256r1 > alice.key

# Request a certificate using the existing key
# We specify the challenge type as email with the -c option,
# and the key with the -k option.
ndnd certcli -o alice -k alice.key -c email testbed.root.pem

# Enter the email address and code as before
```
